# SeeFood

SeeFood (inspired by the HBO show Silicon Valley) is a food image classification app. 
Currently this app supports the following foods: Pizza, French Fries, Burger and Cheesecake. It is easy to train the underlying convolutional neural network to recognize other food products. 

### The list of libraries that were used to build this project are as follows:
- Keras (built on Tensorflow by Google)
- PythonImagingLibrary

### Instructions to run the web app on your own computer:
1. [Download the keras model for SeeFood](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I4QpYFwl_R2Ol0IKnQc7Y20oJLb2reU1?usp=sharing)
2. Put the model in the same directory as main.py
3. Run main.py
